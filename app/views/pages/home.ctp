	Codemitts is all about social coding. You can jump in and at the press of a button you'll have a <em>user submitted programming task</em> that someone wants completed in <em>your favorite language</em>. So wether you're a programmer who can't figure out what your next hobby project should be, or a programmer with great ideas that you never complete. There'll be plenty of things for you to do here.
